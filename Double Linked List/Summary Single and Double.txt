Review

Let's briefly review the performance of the singly linked list and doubly linked list.

They are similar in many operations:

    Both of them are not able to access the data at a random position in constant time.
    Both of them are able to add a new node after given node or at the beginning of the list in O(1) time.
    Both of them are able to delete the first node in O(1) time.

But it is a little different to delete a given node (including the last node).

    In a singly linked list, it is not able to get the previous node of a given node so we have to spend O(N) time to find out the previous node before deleting the given node.
    In a doubly linked list, it will be much easier because we can get the previous node with the "prev" reference field. So we can delete a given node in O(1) time.
