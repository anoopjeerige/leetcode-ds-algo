Hash Set
--------
- One implementation of the set data structure to store no repeated values
- Uses hash functions to support quick insertion and deletion
- Python
  Set
  - Unorderd collection of distinct hashable objects (All python's immutable built-in types
  are hashable, mutable containers like list or dict are not)
  - Similar to other collections, supports
    x in set,
    len(set)
    for x in set
  - Being unordered collections, does not record element position or insertion order
  - As a mutable container, supports
    add()
    remove(elem) - raises KeyError if element not in set
    discard(elem) - remove if present

- Java
  Set
  - A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements, mathematical set abstraction
  - Three general purpose implementations: 
    - HashSet()
    - TreeSet() 
    - LinkedHashSet()
  - Basic operations
    isEmpty()
    add() - boolean return
    remove() - boolean return
