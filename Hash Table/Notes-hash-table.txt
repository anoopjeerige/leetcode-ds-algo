Hash Table
----------
- A data structure that organizes data using hashing functions to support quick insertion and deletion
- Two types of hash tables
  - 1) Hash Set
    One of the implementation of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
  - 2) Hash Map
    One of the implementation of a map data structure to store key value pairs.
- By choosing a proper hash function, the hash table can achieve wonderful performance in both insertion and deletion.

Design of Hash Table
--------------------
- Principle of hash table
  Key idea is to use a hash function to map keys to buckets,
  During insertion, the key is passed to the hash function which assigns the key to a specfic bucket,
  and during retrieval of that key, the same hash function is used to find the and search the specfic bucket.

- Two important factors for designing a hash table
  - Hash Function:
    - A hash function depends on the range of the key values and the number of buckets.
    - Core idea is to assign the keys to the buckets as uniform as possible.
    - The hash function cannot be perfect and there is tradeoff between number of buckets and capacity of a bucket.

  - Collision resolution:
    - A perfect hash function provides one-to-one mapping of the keys and buckets
    - Normally collision are inevitable and collision resolution is required.
    - Collision resolution should solve questions of:
      - Organizing values in the same bucket
      - Too many values assigned to same bucket
      - Search specific target in a bucket
    - The above questions relate to the capacity of the bucket and the number of keys that might be mapped into the same bucket.
    - For a given bucket, that holds maximum number of N keys,
      - if N is constant and small, then a array be used to store keys in the same bucket
      - if N is variable or large, then a height-balanced binary search tree can be used.

- For a qiven requirement, the hash function is determined, and collision resolution is applied if needed,
  and basic operations of insertion and search are provided, all other operations are based on these two.
